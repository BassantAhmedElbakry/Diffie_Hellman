# Diffie_Hellman
This Python code demonstrates Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. Each party generates a private number and uses it to create a public key based on publicly known values. By exchanging these public keys and performing some calculations, both parties can derive the same secret key without ever revealing their private numbers. The code includes a check to verify successful key exchange.
